Small program for personal use.

And an experiment to put AI to work with Nim.

### I want to make a replacement of linux's date command/program.
### To output date. however there are some rules.
### When the program is called, it will show the HOUR (H).
### Then it will delete that after x milliseconds.
### Then it will print the MINUTES (M) for x milliseconds.
### Then it will clear it as well or exit.
### It is temporary information.
